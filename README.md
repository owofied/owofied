# Hey there, I'm owofied! (formerly xiro) 👋

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile :D 
I'm a self-taught software engineer with about 2.5 years of experience.

I use arch (btw)

## What I'm up to

I'm really happy to share some of the cool projects I've been working on:

1. **[VigilantTF](https://github.com/VigilantTF)**: Third-party anticheat solution for Team Fortress 2
2. **[PurrPass](https://github.com/XiroXD/PurrPass)**: Password manager that reinvents the wheel...
3. **OwO Bot**: Discord selfbot written in Python that was intended to be public but ended up being private for obvious reasons...

Feel free to check out my repositories for more of my work!
