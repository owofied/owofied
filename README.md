# Hey there, I'm owofied! (formerly xiro) üëã

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile :D 
I'm a 14 year old self-taught software developer with about 2.5 years of experience (although my github repos don't show it :p).
I use arch (btw)

## What I'm up to

I'm really happy to share some of the cool projects I've been working on:

1. **[Sharify](https://sharify.in)**: File-sharing service, which is probably the most successful project I've ever done with my friend.

2. **OwO Bot**: Discord selfbot written in Python that was intended to be public but ended up being private for obvious reasons...

Feel free to check out my repositories for more of my work!

## Tech Stack

I like to experiment with a lot of different programming languages, frameworks, tools, and other things like that.

Here are a few of my favorites:
